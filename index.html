    <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p>
        When change is mandatory and interventions of Leadership and interim management were not successful it’s time for
        a totally different approach. Traditional, Old School approach by finding compromises and consensus are at
        best, bringing only a part of a (short term) solution and is unsustainable in today’s agile markets.
    </p>
    <p>FTR brings proven - out of the box - sustainable value adding solutions,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>flexibility that enables companies to up- and downscale anytime without costly
            restructuring costs
        </li>
        <li>performance driven management that is capable to drive and develop the business</li>
        <li>continuous improvement to stay connected with clients, market and company objectives</li>
        <li>improve employer branding, to attract, develop and retain talents</li>
        <li>performance management rewarding value creation with clear KPI’s translating into incentives and remuneration packages

    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>In most, if not all, cases we have been involved in, we noticed a lack of</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Competent leadership</li>
        <li>Setting the right priorities</li>
        <li>Engaging and motivating communication</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The above are FTR strongholds, clients find our approach refreshing, transparent and motivating to work
        with.

        FTR does not offer a ‘one size fits all’ approach, but offers pragmatic, customer made, value adding solutions
        respecting company legacy and with respect and empathy for the individual employee.

        After defining and agreeing to the change project plan, we will appoint a hand-picked Transformation Team.

            <h2 class="text-center">Intake</h2>
            <p>
                Engaging into a company transformation is a demanding and irrevocable process once started. A good
                understanding of the value creation, the critical drivers for change and the impact on the organization is key
                for a successful implementation. The Intake report provides this clarity by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>defining areas for improvement,</li>
                <li>mapping priorities,</li>
                <li>indicating timelines,</li>
                <li>inventory of (potential) risks,</li>
                <li>indicating Transformation project cost and Transformation related costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Intake report is leading for any Transformation Project.

                The one-off Intake Report cost is a non committing fee, after receiving the Intake report its the client decision to enter into the next phase, 
                kick-starting the Transformation Project, or not.


                FTR needs – at most - one week on-site assessment to report back on transformation changes needed to
                create the envisioned future organisation.


                Once agreed to the Transformation Plan the next step is creating a competence, capability staged assessment of the Sr. and Middle Management.

            <h2 class="text-center">Management assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Present company status is a direct result of decisions taken by Sr. Management anticipating on market- and
                customers dynamics, economy and linked to company strategy.
                When a company future and results are a concern, it makes sense to assess the competence and
                capabilities of all managerial layers and to see if there is alignment with all in- and external stake- and shareholders.
