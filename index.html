    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>In most of the assignments, we notice a lack of fundamental business necessities</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Competent leadership</li>
        <li>Clear objectives and priorities</li>
        <li>People engagement, Motivation and Communication</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Finding sustainable solutions for these points are FTR specialist expertise. Clients find our approach refreshing and transparent.

        FTR does not offer a ‘one size fits all’ approach, 
        > we offer bespoke, value adding solutions
        > Respect company history and work with employees
        > We define and agree a change project plan
        > Assign a Specialist Transformation Team to deliver long term sustanable solutions for our clients

            <p>
                Engaging into a company transformation is a demanding and specialist proces. Understanding value cfreation and the critical drivers 
                for change are the keys for a successfull implementation. The Intake report provides this clarity by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify areas for improvement,</li>
                <li>Map priorities,</li>
                <li>Assess areas of (potential) risks,</li>
                <li> Highlight Transformation Project cost
                    
                Our intake report is leading for any Transformation Project.

                The one-off Intake Report cost is a non committing fee. After receiving our Intake report its the client's decision to enter into the next phase, 
                kick-starting the Transformation Project.


                FTR requires 5 days for an on-site assessment to formulate the transformation steps and create the envisioned future organization.

                When a companies future or results are in question, it makes sense to assess the competence and capabilities

    <h1>Cost Transparency</h1>

    <p>
        FTR is very clear in its communication, approach and costs.
        Many years of expertise learned us to evaluate, create and translate a Transformation Plan into fixed costs
        allowing our clients to plan and budget for change.
        <br/><br/>
        Depending on the scope of the Transformation Plan we offer various options:
    </p>

    <div class="cost-box-container">

        <div class="cost-box">
            <h2 class="cost-box-header">Fixed Intake fee</h2>
            <p>
                Engaging into a Transformation project is an irrevocable process, a good understanding of impact, next steps, 
                stages and costs are key drivers and mandatory for a success implementation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The Intake report provides this clarity prior to committing to the Transformation
                    Plan.
                </li>
                <li> The Intake will be done at a pre-agreed fixed rate.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cost-box">
            <h2 class="cost-box-header">Project Plan staged invoicing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Roadmap (Project Plan) will clearly indicate process, ownership, timelines and progress.</li>
                <li>With a fixed fee per stage, based on completion of pre-agreed, defined next steps and/or
                    deliverables
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="cost-box">
            <h2 class="cost-box-header">All-in monthly rate with success based incentive</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If the Transformation Plan is in some cases strongly dependent on logical next steps (e.g Works Council or Trade Union related
                    processes), as timelines are impacted hereby we can also agree on a all-in monthly fee.
                </li>
                <li>This fee is independent of the number FTR Specialists working on the Transformation Plan
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cost-box">
            <h2 class="cost-box-header">All-in fixed Transformation Plan fee</h2>
            <p>
                FTR uniquely offers for mid- to large sized Transformation Projects an all-in fixed fee with a success
                based incentive for on time and within budget delivery
                <br/>
                It allows for clear budgetting, full transparency on costs important for share- and stakeholders.
